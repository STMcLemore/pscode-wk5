// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

-ask for a number
   if number is divisible by 2 print "even"
   else print "odd"




// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


-ask for 5 separate numbers
-add the 5 numbers together and divide sum by 5 and set to {avg}
-find number with lowest value and set to {min}
-find number with highest value and set to {max}

print "average is {avg}"
print "smallest number is {min}"
print "largest number is {max}"
